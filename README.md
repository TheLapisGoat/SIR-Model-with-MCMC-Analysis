# Analysis of Covid19 with the SIR model and Metropolis Hastings
(MA41017) Stochastic Processes Project

Used the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered) compartmental model to model Covid19, with parameters &#946; and &#947; being estimated with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The Covid19 data used for the analysis has been scraped from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/), 
with the data orginally being from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare ([MoHFW](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/)), India.

Most of the analysis is done in [SIR.ipynb](./SIR.ipynb).
